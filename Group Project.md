## Group Project

### Overview

The group project allows students to apply text mining and sentiment analysis techniques in a real-world business analytics context. Students will form their own groups, select a relevant text dataset, and perform in-depth analysis using methods learned in class. The goal is to generate insights that could inform business decisions, demonstrate technical competence, and effectively communicate findings.

### Group Formation

- Groups must consist of **1 to 6 students**.
- Groups are **self-formed**; you are responsible for organizing your team.
- Project scope and depth should **scale with group size**. Larger groups are expected to demonstrate more ambitious analysis and deliverables.

### Project Topic and Dataset

Each group must select a **text-based dataset** relevant to business or industry (e.g., customer reviews, social media data, product descriptions, news articles, earnings call transcripts, etc.).
