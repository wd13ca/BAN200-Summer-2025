{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"39843489","metadata":{"id":"39843489"},"source":["# Week 4 Lecture Notes\n","\n","This week, we built our first **supervised machine learning classifier** from scratch — a Naive Bayes model for **spam detection**. Along the way, we compared rule-based and learning-based approaches, reviewed key ML concepts, and connected everything back to ideas we've already explored in sentiment analysis. By the end of this unit, you’ll understand not just how Naive Bayes works, but why it works — and how surprisingly similar it is to the lexicon-based classifier we built earlier.\n","\n","## Rule-Based vs. Machine Learning–Based Systems\n","\n","Before we dive into building our first *machine learning model*, let’s review the difference between two major approaches to analyzing text:\n","\n","### Rule-Based Systems\n","\n","Rule-based systems rely on **handcrafted logic** to analyze text. You define the rules, and the system applies them.\n","\n","**Examples:**\n","\n","- If a message contains the word “refund”, label it as a complaint.\n","- If a review contains more positive than negative words (from a lexicon), predict it as positive.\n","\n","We’ve already seen some rule-based systems in this course:\n","\n","- **Information retrieval** using cosine similarity and TF-IDF is rule-based — it follows a fixed mathematical formula to rank documents.\n","- **Lexicon-based sentiment analysis** is rule-based — it assigns scores to documents based on a predefined dictionary of word sentiments. *Note: you could use machine learning to create the lexicon (e.g., by training on labeled data), but our approach was purely rule-based.*\n","\n","**Pros:**\n","\n","- Simple, interpretable, and easy to build\n","- No training data needed\n","- Good for clear-cut or highly structured tasks\n","\n","**Cons:**\n","\n","- Rigid and brittle — can break with new wording or phrasing\n","- Can’t handle nuance or subtlety (e.g., sarcasm, negation)\n","- Hard to scale and maintain as complexity grows\n","\n","### Machine Learning–Based Systems\n","\n","Machine learning systems **learn patterns from labeled examples** instead of being explicitly told what to do.\n","\n","You give the model **input texts** and the correct **output labels**, and it finds patterns that connect them.\n","\n","**Examples:**\n","\n","- Train a model on 10,000 emails labeled “spam” or “not spam”\n","- Use word frequency patterns to automatically learn what spam looks like\n","- Predict new labels for unseen messages based on learned patterns\n","\n","We’ve already seen a machine learning system:\n","\n","- **K-Means clustering** is an unsupervised ML model — it learns to group similar documents without predefined categories.\n","\n","**Pros:**\n","\n","- Flexible and adaptive — learns from data, not rules\n","- Can capture subtle statistical signals\n","- Scales well to large datasets and complex problems\n","\n","**Cons:**\n","\n","- Needs labeled data to train (in supervised learning)\n","- Can be harder to interpret\n","- May make mistakes in unexpected ways\n","\n","## Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning\n","\n","Now that we’ve reviewed machine learning systems, let’s look at two major types of learning: **supervised** and **unsupervised**.\n","\n","### Unsupervised Learning\n","\n","In **unsupervised learning**, the model is given input data **without any labels**. Its goal is to **find patterns or structure** in the data on its own.\n","\n","**Example: K-Means Clustering**\n","\n","- We gave K-Means a set of review vectors — but **no labels** or categories.\n","- The model grouped similar reviews into clusters based on shared vocabulary.\n","- We didn’t tell the model what the clusters should be — it discovered patterns automatically.\n","\n","Unsupervised learning is useful when:\n","- You don’t have labeled data\n","- You want to explore or summarize large datasets\n","- You want to discover hidden structure or themes\n","\n","### Supervised Learning\n","\n","In **supervised learning**, the model is trained on input data **with known labels**. It learns the relationship between the input and the correct output, so it can make predictions on new data.\n","\n","**What We’re Doing Today: Naive Bayes**\n","\n","- We'll build a **spam detection model** using a dataset of messages labeled as **spam** or **not spam**.\n","- The model will learn what kinds of words are commonly found in spam messages vs. regular ones.\n","- Once trained, the model can classify **new, unseen messages** as spam or not.\n","\n","> **Key Idea**:  \n","> Supervised learning requires labeled data and predicts known outcomes.  \n","> Unsupervised learning looks for patterns without any guidance.\n","\n","\n","## Introducing Naive Bayes: A Machine Learning Approach to Text Classification\n","\n","So far, we’ve built a **lexicon-based sentiment classifier**:  \n","\n","- Every word in a review had a predefined **sentiment score** (positive, negative, or neutral).  \n","- To score a review, we **added up the scores of the words it contained**.  \n","- Based on the total score, we classified the review as **positive, neutral, or negative**.\n","\n","Today, we’ll build a new kind of text classifier — using **machine learning**.  \n","\n","Our task is to classify messages as either **spam** or **not spam** (also called *ham*).  \n","\n","We’ll use a model called **Naive Bayes**, which is commonly used for spam detection.\n","\n","### Similarities to the Lexicon Model\n","\n","In both models:\n","\n","- Each message is represented as a **bag of words**\n","- Each word contributes to the **final message score**\n","- The final score determines the predicted **class label**:\n","  - Positive vs. Negative (in sentiment analysis)\n","  - Spam vs. Not Spam (in today’s example)\n","\n","### Key Difference: Where the Word Scores Come From\n","\n","- In the **lexicon model**, the word scores were **manually defined** in a sentiment dictionary.  \n","- In the **Naive Bayes model**, the word scores will be **learned from data**.  \n","  - We’ll train the model on **labeled messages** — ones that are already marked as spam or not.\n","  - The model will learn which words are more likely to appear in spam vs. ham.\n","\n","This is what makes Naive Bayes a **supervised machine learning model**.\n","\n","> **Key Idea**:  \n","> Just like our lexicon-based model, Naive Bayes uses word-level scores to make a prediction —  \n","> but it **learns** those scores automatically by analyzing a labeled dataset.\n","\n","## Deriving Naive Bayes for Spam Detection\n","\n","To understand how our model works, we’ll start with **Bayes’ Rule** — a fundamental idea in probability theory.\n","\n","### Bayes’ Rule\n","\n","Bayes’ Rule helps us reverse conditional probabilities:\n","\n","**P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)**\n","\n","In our case:\n","\n","- **A** is the class (e.g., \"spam\" or \"not spam\")\n","- **B** is the message text\n","\n","We want to calculate:\n","\n","**P(spam | message)** — the probability that a message is spam, given its contents.\n","\n","Using Bayes’ Rule:\n","\n","**P(spam | message) = P(message | spam) * P(spam) / P(message)**\n","\n","And likewise:\n","\n","**P(ham | message) = P(message | ham) * P(ham) / P(message)**\n","\n","To classify the message, we compare these two probabilities and choose the class with the higher value.\n","\n","### The Naive Assumption\n","\n","The tricky part is computing **P(message | spam)** — the probability of the entire message, given that it’s spam.\n","\n","Since messages are made up of many words, this would normally be very hard to compute.  \n","So we make a simplifying assumption:\n","\n","> **Naive Bayes assumes that all words in a message are independent, given the class.**\n","\n","That means:\n","\n","**P(message | spam)**  \n","≈ **P(w1 | spam) * P(w2 | spam) * ... * P(wn | spam)**\n","\n","We do the same for ham:\n","\n","**P(message | ham)**  \n","≈ **P(w1 | ham) * P(w2 | ham) * ... * P(wn | ham)**\n","\n","### The Final Classification Rule\n","\n","Now we can skip the denominator (P(message)) because it’s the same for both classes.\n","\n","To classify a message, we compute:\n","\n","- **spam score = P(spam) * P(w1 | spam) * P(w2 | spam) * ...**\n","- **ham score = P(ham) * P(w1 | ham) * P(w2 | ham) * ...**\n","\n","Then we pick the class with the higher score.\n","\n","### Take the Log\n","\n","Multiplying lots of small probabilities (like 0.01 × 0.005 × 0.0008...) can lead to **very tiny numbers** that computers have trouble storing.  \n","\n","Instead, we take the **logarithm** of the scores, which turns multiplication into addition:\n","\n","**log(spam score) = log(P(spam)) + log(P(w1 | spam)) + log(P(w2 | spam)) + ...**\n","\n","And the same for ham:\n","\n","**log(ham score) = log(P(ham)) + log(P(w1 | ham)) + log(P(w2 | ham)) + ...**\n","\n","This gives us a much more stable calculation — and it’s also easier to interpret.\n","\n","### Final Classification Rule\n","\n","We subtract the two log-scores and check the sign of the result:\n","\n","**score = log(spam score) - log(ham score)**  \n","= **log(P(spam) / P(ham))**  \n","  + **sum over words: log(P(word | spam) / P(word | ham))**\n","\n","This gives us a **single number** that summarizes how \"spammy\" the message is.\n","\n","### How to Make a Prediction\n","\n","- If the score is **greater than 0**, the message is **more likely spam**\n","- If the score is **less than 0**, the message is **more likely ham (not spam)**\n","- If the score is **exactly 0**, the model is completely uncertain (rare)\n","\n","\n","### Why This Looks Like a Lexicon Model\n","\n","- In lexicon-based sentiment analysis, we added up the **sentiment scores** of each word.\n","- In Naive Bayes (after taking logs), we add up the **spaminess scores** of each word:\n","  - For each word: **log(P(word | spam) / P(word | ham))**\n","\n","This becomes our **spam lexicon**, but instead of being handcrafted, it's **learned from data**.\n","\n","### What About the Constant?\n","\n","In our log-based Naive Bayes classifier, the full formula looks like this:\n","\n","**score = log(P(spam) / P(ham))  \n","  + sum over words: log(P(word | spam) / P(word | ham))**\n","\n","The first part — **log(P(spam) / P(ham))** — is a **constant**. It doesn’t depend on the message or its words. It just reflects how common spam is in the training data compared to ham.\n","\n","#### What Does It Mean?\n","\n","- If spam is more common than ham in the training set, the constant will be **positive**\n","- If ham is more common, the constant will be **negative**\n","\n","This constant shifts the final score **up or down** and acts as a **bias term**:\n","- A high constant makes the model more likely to predict spam (unless the words strongly suggest otherwise)\n","- A low constant makes the model more conservative (only labeling as spam if the words are very spammy)\n","\n","#### Why Don’t We Have This in Lexicon-Based Sentiment?\n","\n","In our sentiment model, we only use the sum of word scores — there’s **no class prior** built into the model.\n","\n","That means:\n","- We assume that positive and negative reviews are equally likely by default\n","- There's **no bias toward one label or the other** unless the words push it in that direction\n","\n","If we wanted to, we could **add a constant** to our sentiment model to reflect prior expectations — for example, if we know most reviews tend to be positive — but in practice, we usually leave it out for simplicity.\n","\n","## SMS Spam Collection\n","\n","Now that we understand how the Naive Bayes model works, let’s put it into practice.\n","\n","We’ll be using a real-world dataset called the **SMS Spam Collection**. It contains **5,574 text messages**, each labeled as either:\n","\n","- **\"spam\"** — unwanted commercial messages, scams, or promotions\n","- **\"ham\"** — regular, non-spam messages (e.g., from friends, family, or service providers)\n","\n","This dataset is widely used to teach and evaluate text classification models, and it's perfect for our goal today.\n","\n","### Our Objective\n","\n","We want to **train a Naive Bayes classifier** that can automatically determine whether a new message is spam or not.\n","\n","To do that, we’ll:\n","\n","1. **Load the dataset**\n","2. **Tokenize the messages**\n","3. **Estimate word probabilities for each class**\n","4. **Compute log-scores for new messages**\n","5. **Make predictions and evaluate accuracy**\n","\n","This is a classic example of **supervised learning**:\n","\n","- We train the model on a set of **labeled examples**\n","- The model learns which words are more likely to appear in spam vs. ham\n","- It uses this to classify **new, unseen messages**\n","\n","Let’s get started by loading and exploring the data.\n","\n","## Download and Load the Dataset\n","\n","The SMS Spam Collection is available as a **tab-delimited text file** where:\n","\n","- The first column is the **label** (`ham` or `spam`)\n","- The second column is the **message text**\n","\n","We’ll download the file using `wget`, then read it into a DataFrame using `pandas`."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"ee3d8f89","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":397},"id":"ee3d8f89","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747954528348,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":1779,"user":{"displayName":"Will Dick","userId":"09439979286280420660"}},"outputId":"afe332ec-56f2-48c3-9b80-deb359de20e9"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["--2025-05-22 22:55:26--  https://storage.googleapis.com/wd13/SMSSpamCollection.txt\n","Resolving storage.googleapis.com (storage.googleapis.com)... 142.251.16.207, 142.251.163.207, 142.251.167.207, ...\n","Connecting to storage.googleapis.com (storage.googleapis.com)|142.251.16.207|:443... connected.\n","HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK\n","Length: 477907 (467K) [text/plain]\n","Saving to: ‘SMSSpamCollection.txt’\n","\n","\rSMSSpamCollection.t   0%[                    ]       0  --.-KB/s               \rSMSSpamCollection.t 100%[===================>] 466.71K  --.-KB/s    in 0.01s   \n","\n","2025-05-22 22:55:26 (42.8 MB/s) - ‘SMSSpamCollection.txt’ saved [477907/477907]\n","\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["  label                                            message\n","0   ham  Go until jurong point, crazy..
